# Digital Critical Infrastructure (CI) Design Prompt  

## **Objective**  
Design a secure, scalable, and resilient **Digital Critical Infrastructure (CI)** that ensures the continuous operation of essential services. The system should incorporate best practices in cybersecurity, cloud computing, and AI-driven monitoring while adhering to regulatory frameworks and risk management principles.

## **Key Requirements**  

### **1. Infrastructure Scope**  
- Define the **type of critical infrastructure** (e.g., power grid, healthcare, financial services, transportation, smart cities).  
- Identify the essential services the infrastructure must support.  

### **2. Architecture Design**  
- Specify whether the CI is **cloud-based, hybrid, or on-premises**.  
- Define **network topology** and **data flow** across components.  
- Consider **redundancy** and **fault tolerance** mechanisms.  

### **3. Security & Resilience**  
- Implement **zero-trust security architecture** with **multi-layer defense mechanisms**.  
- Define cybersecurity controls like **encryption, IAM (Identity and Access Management), and intrusion detection**.  
- Include **incident response** and **disaster recovery** strategies.  

### **4. Data & AI Integration**  
- Ensure **real-time monitoring and predictive analytics** using AI/ML.  
- Implement **automated threat detection** and **anomaly detection** systems.  
- Define **data governance, compliance, and privacy** measures.  

### **5. Scalability & Performance**  
- Support **high availability and load balancing** for uninterrupted service.  
- Define **edge computing and IoT integrations** if applicable.  
- Use **containerization (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker)** for scalability.  

### **6. Compliance & Regulations**  
- Align with **GDPR, NIST, ISO 27001, and local regulatory frameworks**.  
- Define policies for **data sovereignty, auditing, and reporting**.
