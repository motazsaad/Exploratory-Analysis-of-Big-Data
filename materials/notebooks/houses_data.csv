1800,3,Urban,350000,"Given the data provided, houses with a similar size (1800 sqft), number of bedrooms (3), and located in an Urban area have priced around $300,000 to $400,000. With 1800 sqft being halfway between the given house sizes, we can estimate the price to be closer to the midpoint of the provided prices, which is $350,000."
2200,4,Suburban,468000,"The given data shows that houses with 2000 sqft for 4 bedrooms located in Suburban areas cost $400,000. Therefore, to predict the price of a house with 2200 sqft and 4 bedrooms in the same location, we can calculate it as follows: ($400,000 - $300,000) / (2200 - 2000) = $50 per sqft. Applying this to our new house size gives us a predicted price of $468,000."
1500,2,Rural,225000,"Based on the provided data, houses with a size of 1500 sqft in rural areas have an average price of $300,000 for 3 bedrooms and $200,000 for 2 bedrooms. With 2 bedrooms and a rural location, we can estimate that this house is priced at approximately $225,000."
2800,5,Suburban,560000,The predicted price is based on the house size and location. The average price per sqft in Suburban areas is considered.
1200,2,Urban,240000,"Based on the provided data, houses with a similar size (1200 sqft), number of bedrooms (2), and location (Urban) are priced at 300000. The average price per sqft in Urban areas is approximately 200 per sqft ($300000 / 1500 sqft = $200/sqft). Applying this rate to the new house size of 1200 sqft results in a predicted price of $240,000."
