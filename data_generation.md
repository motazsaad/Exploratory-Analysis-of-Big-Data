## [Mostly AI](https://mostly.ai)  
Synthetic data is created by Generative AI models trained on real-world data samples. The algorithms first learn the patterns, correlations, and statistical properties of the sample data. Once trained, the Generator can create statistically identical synthetic data.  

The synthetic data looks and feels the same as the original data the algorithms were trained on. However, the big advantage is that the synthetic data does not contain any personal information.
